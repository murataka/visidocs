### Abstarct

##### In low level languages like C, we face some common problems if we are accessing the memory (ram) frequently.

#### This repository is intended to be useful for developers who will begin to deal such a project , or already ongoing projects.   

# List of problems we discuss here:

1. Choosing convenient hardware and system components
  - Alternative tools and problem oriented design
  - Foreseeing the technology

2. Dealing with possible future problems
  - Problems in C/C++
  - C based problems
  - Comparison of some possible solutions
